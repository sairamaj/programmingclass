Today we have recapped last week session which are hardware,software,binary system etc.,

We have defined __bit__ which is one binary digit which is smallest data in computer system which can take either 0 or 1. 2 bits can carry 4 values which are 00(0), 01(1), 10(2), 11(3).

   |    number of bits   |  number of values     |   values |
   | ------------------  | -----------------     |----------|
   |     1 (2^1)         |     2                 |   0-1    |
   |     2 (2^2)         |     4                 |   0-3    |
   |     3 (2^3)         |     8                 |   0-7    |
   |     4 (2^4)         |    16                 |   0-15   |
   |     5 (2^5)         |    32                 |   0-31   |
   |     6 (2^6)         |    64                 |   0-63   |
   |     7 (2^7)         |   128                 |   0-127  |
   |     8 (2^8)         |   256                 |   0-128  |

If you see above 8 bits can carry 256 values which are plenty for alphabets+numbers+other characters. All [ASCII](http://ascii.cl/) can fit in to these 256 values. Earlier computers grouped 8 bits and called as __Byte__


   |                                |     1 bytes                                                | -----------------------------    | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
   |     8 bits                     |     1 bytes                                                |
   |  1024 bytes    (10^3)          |     1 Kilo byte  ( it is no 1000 as it is exponent of 2)   |
   |  1024*1024 bytes  (10^6)       |     1 Mega byte                                            |
   |  1024*1024*1024 bytes  (10^9)  |     1 Giga byte                                            |
